## Climate-Smart Practices

### Water Conservation
1. **Drip Irrigation**: 40-60% water saving
2. **Mulching**: Reduces evaporation by 50%
3. **Rainwater Harvesting**: Critical for sustainability
4. **Contour Bunding**: Prevents soil erosion
5. **Farm Ponds**: Store rainwater for dry periods

### Soil Health Management
1. **Organic Matter**: Add 5-10 tonnes FYM per hectare
2. **Green Manuring**: Dhaincha, Sunhemp before main crop
3. **Crop Rotation**: Legumes-Cereals-Commercial crops
4. **Cover Crops**: Protect soil during fallow periods
5. **Reduced Tillage**: Preserves soil structure

### Integrated Farming Systems
1. **Crop + Livestock**: Dairy with fodder crops
2. **Crop + Horticulture**: Mixed farming systems
3. **Crop + Fishery**: Where water bodies available
4. **Crop + Poultry**: Integrated approach
5. **Agro-forestry**: Trees + crops combination

### Climate Resilience Strategies
1. **Crop Diversification**: Reduce weather risks
2. **Early Warning Systems**: Use weather forecasts
3. **Insurance**: Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana
4. **Stress-Tolerant Varieties**: Heat and drought resistant
5. **Flexible Planting**: Adjust to monsoon patterns

## Recommended Cropping Patterns for Pune

### Rainfed Areas (400-600mm rainfall)
- **Pattern 1**: Jowar - Gram
